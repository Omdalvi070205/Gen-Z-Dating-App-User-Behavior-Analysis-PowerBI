### üìå Project Overview
This dashboard aims to uncover patterns and trends in how Gen-Z users interact with dating applications. By analyzing data from 500 users across 7 major Indian cities, we can understand user motivations, satisfaction levels with different apps, and daily usage habits. This information is valuable for product managers, marketers, and anyone interested in the online dating landscape.

#### üí° Key Insights
Top Location: Mumbai has the highest concentration of users (82), followed by Delhi and Kolkata.

Primary Motivation: The main reasons users are on these apps are to Find a Partner and for Social Interaction, rather than just casual fun or dating.

App-Specific Behavior: Apps like OkCupid and Hinge show a significant number of users looking to "Find a Partner".

User Satisfaction: User satisfaction varies across different platforms. For instance, Bumble appears to have a high count of users reporting a satisfaction level of '2', while Tinder has more users at a satisfaction level of '4'.

Usage by Occupation: Full-time employees and Freelancers constitute the largest segments of daily users.
